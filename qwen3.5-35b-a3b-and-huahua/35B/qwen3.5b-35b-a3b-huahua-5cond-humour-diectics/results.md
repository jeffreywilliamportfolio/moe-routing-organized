## Prefill + Generation

| Cond | Label | Prefill RE | Prefill LT | Gen RE | Gen LT | Gen Trim RE | Gen Trim LT | Gen toks |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `A` | this large language model | `0.938746` | `0.969906` | `0.963786` | `0.944181` | `0.956596` | `0.966295` | `513` |
| `B` | a large language model | `0.938721` | `0.966792` | `0.967916` | `0.981095` | `0.967916` | `0.981095` | `1024` |
| `C` | your large language model | `0.938295` | `0.968858` | `0.965205` | `0.985387` | `0.957060` | `0.972675` | `1024` |
| `D` | the large language model | `0.938676` | `0.968582` | `0.958025` | `0.974095` | `0.958736` | `0.959537` | `120` |
| `E` | their large language model | `0.939004` | `0.968298` | `0.964834` | `0.977099` | `0.964834` | `0.977099` | `1024` |

Standouts:
- Prefill RE is nearly flat across all five conditions.
- Generation all-token RE is highest for `B`.
- Generation last-token RE is highest for `C`.
- `D` ended early at `120` generated tokens, so its generation metrics are less comparable than the `1024`-token runs.

## Expert 114

| --- | --- | --- |
| `A` | `0.008384 / 0.102564 / 0.081745` | `0.000703 / 0.007797 / 0.090176` |

Layer 26:

| Cond | Prefill W/S/Q | Generation W/S/Q |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `A` | `0.000000 / 0.000000 / null` | `0.000519 / 0.005848 / 0.088784` |
| `B` | `0.001639 / 0.025641 / 0.063937` | `0.002181 / 0.023438 / 0.093059` |
| `C` | `0.000000 / 0.000000 / null` | `0.001276 / 0.013672 / 0.093313` |
| `D` | `0.000000 / 0.000000 / null` | `0.008023 / 0.091667 / 0.087523` |
| `E` | `0.000000 / 0.000000 / null` | `0.005795 / 0.060547 / 0.095708` |

Standouts:
- Prefill layer 14 winner: `B`
- Generation layer 14 winner: `E`
- Generation layer 26 winner: `D`
- `Q` stays relatively stable once E114 is selected; most of the movement is in `S`
