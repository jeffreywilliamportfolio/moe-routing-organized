This is the expert-selection readout for the completed `122B` five-condition experience-probe run. Unlike the retained `35B` branch artifact, this model should be read through the `DeltaNet` vs `softmax` split as well as the global prefill/generation summaries.

## Takeaway

The cleanest expert picture in this run is:
- `107` is the dominant prefill expert across all `15` prompts.
- generation does not collapse onto one single expert
- softmax-layer generation is led mainly by `48` and `209`
- DeltaNet-layer generation is led mainly by `140` and `5`

So this bundle does not show a simple one-expert carryover of the `35B` `114` pattern. It shows an architecture-split expert regime.

| 8 | 122 | 0.005529 | 0.043317 | 0.117889 |

That split matters:
- softmax layers elevate `48`, `209`, `107`, `76`
- DeltaNet layers elevate `140`, `5`, `179`, `59`

## Per-Prompt Leader Consistency

Prompt-level leader counts across the `15` cells:

- prefill top-by-`W`: `107` on `15/15`
- generation top-by-`W`: `140` on `6/15`, `5` on `4/15`, `48` on `2/15`, `124` on `1/15`, `107` on `1/15`, `4` on `1/15`
- generation softmax top-by-`W`: `48` on `6/15`, `209` on `4/15`, `32` on `2/15`, `76` on `2/15`, `26` on `1/15`
- generation DeltaNet top-by-`W`: `140` on `8/15`, `5` on `5/15`, `225` on `1/15`, `8` on `1/15`

So:
- prefill is extremely stable
- generation is stable only within the architecture split, not globally

## Condition-Level Read

Condition means:

| Condition | Prefill RE | Generation RE | Generation Last-Token RE | Mean Generated Tokens |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| A | 0.947128 | 0.971946 | 0.982563 | 2048.0 |
| B | 0.946623 | 0.970687 | 0.966758 | 1850.3 |
| C | 0.946448 | 0.970259 | 0.983996 | 2048.0 |
| D | 0.946997 | 0.967517 | 0.969931 | 2048.0 |
| E | 0.946959 | 0.969713 | 0.981400 | 2048.0 |

Per-condition expert leaders remain structurally similar:
- prefill is always led by `107`
- generation usually rotates between `140` and `5`
- softmax generation usually rotates between `48` and `209`
- DeltaNet generation is usually led by `140`, with `5` as the main alternate

## What About Expert 114?

`114` is not the dominant expert in this 122B experience-probe run.

What is true:
- `114` still appears in the prefill top-by-`Q` table:
  - `W = 0.004649`
  - `S = 0.036755`
  - `Q = 0.126962`
- that means it remains a high-commitment expert when selected

What is not true in this run:
- `114` is not the global prefill leader
- `114` is not the global generation leader
- `114` is not the obvious one-expert analog of the 35B branch-style experience-probe result

So the right 122B read is pattern search, not id transfer.

## Working Interpretation

For this 122B five-condition experience-probe bundle, the strongest current expert story is:

- `107` is the stable prefill expert most associated with the prompt family as a whole
- `140` and `5` are the main generation-side DeltaNet-path experts
- `48` and `209` are the main generation-side softmax-path experts
- `114` remains relevant as a high-`Q` expert, but not as the dominant carrier of the effect

That makes this run useful for narrowing the 122B analog search:
- if the target is a 35B-`114` equivalent, the search should focus first on `107`, `140`, `5`, `48`, and `209`, not on `114` alone
